### as i have been tinkering with impact i noticed i can change certain aspects and make the loading screen say different things   like giving hints in "said game" like making

### "{div class="entityDefinition">span class="key">x/span>:span class="value">188</span</div}" into


### "{div class="entityDefinition">span class="key">x</span:<span class="value">49</span</div}" to make it smaller in size for fitting better


### i can also change diferent data sets for the map of the game by using code like this {
	init: function( tilesize, data ) {
		this.tilesize = tilesize;
		this.data = data;
		this.height = data.length;
		this.width = data[0].length;}

       And for winnter break goal i wanna do better at the things i like for example coding with impact and improviing my skills in other activities i enjoy doing like creating stuff in unity and blender  like making 3d models (will put an image of what im talking about for unity when i get home)
